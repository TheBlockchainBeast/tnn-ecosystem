# Content guidelines

## Tone

- **Friendly, inclusive, unpretentious, empowering.**
- Avoid jargon when a plain word works; explain terms in tooltips or Education when needed.
- Speak to "you" and "your" (e.g. "Your portfolio", "Your first swap").

## Taglines / messaging

- "Where Nobodies Become Somebodies"
- "DeFi for Everyone, Built by the Community"
- "Your Network, Your Future"

## Microcopy examples

- **CTA:** "Connect Wallet", "Review swap", "Confirm swap", "Export CSV", "Make your first swap".
- **Empty states:** "Your latest swaps will appear here.", "Connect a wallet to see your tokens."
- **Errors:** "Something went wrong. Please try again." or specific message (e.g. "Quote expired. Get a new quote.").
- **Success:** "Swap complete." or inline update (e.g. history row added).

## Risk and safety

- Use warnings for high slippage or high price impact.
- Before first-time actions (e.g. first swap), optional short risk reminder.
- Contract addresses: show truncated with copy; link to explorer.

## Accessibility

- Buttons and links have clear labels (or `aria-label`).
- Form errors associated with inputs.
- Sufficient color contrast (WCAG 2.1 AA where applicable).
