# User journey: Power user

## Goal

Use the ecosystem as a single hub: dashboard overview, quick actions, and deep dives into Swap/Liquidity/Staking without friction.

## Steps

1. **Dashboard overview**
   - Opens app; sees total portfolio value, 24h change, and widgets (portfolio breakdown, active positions, recent activity, market overview, gas, stats).
   - All positions (LP, stakes, tokens) visible at a glance (when Phase 2+ data exists).

2. **Quick actions**
   - Clicks "Swap" or "Add Liquidity" or "Stake" from dashboard without opening a separate product first.
   - Performs swap/stake from familiar flow.

3. **Deep dive**
   - Uses sidebar (desktop) or "More" (mobile) to open Liquidity, Staking, Launchpad, Bridge, or Governance.
   - Uses advanced options where available (slippage, deadline, limit orders, etc.).

4. **Multi-product workflow**
   - Example: Swap → Add Liquidity → Stake LP tokens.
   - Guided or self-directed; minimal context switching.

## Success metrics

- Feature discovery: &gt; 40% use 2+ products within 30 days.
  30-day retention &gt; 40%; 90-day &gt; 25%.
